##Step 1: Discover & Plan

For the results to be a genuine improvement, we need to discover what your goals are and how these match up with what your users need.

We gather statistics about your current online operation, user flow and conversions to build a picture of where we can improve. We do this by reviewing analytics data gained from your website. You might already have access to this. If not, it can be arranged for you.

Discovery will also involve some communication with the following stakeholders:

- Your customers
- Your board members or MD
- Your staff members

Then we plan exactly what needs to be done and how.

At the end you'll be given a report detailing the results we hope to achieve during the next 2 stages.

##Step 2: Build

We will craft a site that meets the requirements of the report generated in step 1. As well as meeting these requirements, your site will be, as standard:

- Fast: It will load quickly even on slow networks (3G)
- User Friendly: It will be as accessible as possible to people of all abilities
- Built to Last: We build from a base that's easy for future developers to extend and maintain

##Step 3: Refine

It takes time to get good results. That's why we don't expect to meet all our KPIs instantly after launch. This is an ongoing process which will track your Key Performance Indicators over time, charting indicators which give us a good picture of the success of your  business:

- Organic search listings
- Visitors and Bounce Rates
- conversions
