MANIFOLD is the brainchild of Benjamin Read, an award-winning designer / developer from Hertfordshire. Ben is a student of Bauhaus and minimalist design, who constantly reflects on the heyday of the company he worships, Apple.

But Ben quickly identified that there was plenty of creativity to be found in the web medium, and sought to learn to code. As a result, Ben codes in HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and is learning Node. When responsive design really took off, he realised it would challenge every professional designer and lead to a new way of thinking: one in which merely beautiful websites wouldn't be enough.

##Design Thinking Meets The Web
With Responsive design, the Web has really become its own medium. So much more is required of designers and developers to build sites that meet well-defined business and user needs. That is why Ben embarked on a personal journey to understand what this would mean for his craft.

After years of research, whilst still practicing web development to a high standard, we stand ready to build websites which, as well as promoting the company brand, also achieve the following:

- Quickly and easily accessible information
- Fast purchase and checkout routes
- Well written, targeted content that sells
- A clearly defined and refined sales funnel that gets results

Armed with these objectives, MANIFOLD was born.
