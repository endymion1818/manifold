      <h2>How it Works:</h2>
      <div class="col-3rd">
        <h3>Step 1: Discovery &amp; Plan</h3>
        <p>For the results to be a genuine improvement, we need to discover what your goals are and how these match up with what your users need. We gather statistics about your current online operation, user flow and conversions to build a picture of where we can improve. Then we plan exactly how we're going to do that.</p>

      <div class="col-3rd">
        <h3>Step 2: Build</h3>
        <p>We will craft a purpose-built system that suits your business needs as perfectly as possible. Design and development is in-house which means you get maintainable, standards-based results that will be future friendly, easily extendable and easy to maintain.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Refine</h3>
        <p>We don't expect to meet all our KPIs in the first week after launch. This is an ongoing process which will track your Key Performance Indicators over time, charting your meteoric rise to stardom and profit (hopefully).</p>
